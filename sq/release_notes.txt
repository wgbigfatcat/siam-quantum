Editorial Comments
------------------
SQ - Siam Quantum is the ab-initio package that was born out of my
curiosity to study quantum chemistry. After spending 5 years as 
a Ph.D candidate at Purdue University studying applications of quantum
chemistry to a variety of systems, I have always wanted to understand 
the nuts and bolts of how software packages like Gaussian98 and 
Gamess actually perform their calculations. And, the only way to
actually understand it, is to build it myself.

As it turns out, the body of knowledge involved in the ab-initio
calculations are insurmountable. Even a simple matter such as evaluating 
exp(-x) becomes an issue. Therefore, the first version of SQ is mere 
humble copy cat of prior works and preexisting software implementation.
In essence, it can only solve Restricted-Hartree Fock Roothan equations.

Despite it limited functionality, SQ has its own unique usefulness. In 
addition to the aim to produce research quality calculations, it is 
also designed to be a pedagogical tool that students can go through 
the source code and learn about how the calculations are done. A 
complimentary document is provided to clarify how each subroutines 
are implemented down to the algorithmic level. Think of the entire 
source code as a text book, if you will.
